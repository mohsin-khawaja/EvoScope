# 📓 Experiment Showcase Notebook Instructions

## 🚀 Quick Start

The notebook has been fixed and should now work correctly! Here are the different ways to view your experiment results:

### Option 1: Interactive Dashboard (Fastest)
```bash
python showcase_dashboard.py
```
This displays all results in a beautiful command-line interface.

### Option 2: Jupyter Notebook (Most Interactive)
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/experiment_showcase.ipynb
```
Then run all cells to see the interactive analysis.

### Option 3: View Individual Images
All experiment visualizations are saved as PNG files in:
- `experiments/simple_results/lstm_analysis.png`
- `experiments/simple_results/sequence_length_analysis.png`
- `experiments/simple_results/rl_analysis.png`
- `experiments/simple_results/benchmark_analysis.png`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get "FileNotFoundError":
1. **Make sure you're in the right directory**:
   ```bash
   pwd  # Should show: /path/to/rl-lstm-ai-trading-agent
   ```

2. **Check if experiments have been run**:
   ```bash
   ls experiments/simple_results/
   # Should show CSV files and PNG images
   ```

3. **If files are missing, run experiments**:
   ```bash
   python experiments/simple_experiments.py
   ```

### If notebook cells fail:
- The notebook now has automatic path detection
- It will try multiple path options and show which one works
- Run cells in order from top to bottom

## 📊 What You'll See

The notebook showcases all **26 experiments**:

1. **🧠 LSTM Architecture** (6 experiments)
   - Best: 512 hidden units, 2 layers → 63.18% accuracy

2. **📏 Sequence Length** (6 experiments)  
   - Optimal: 60 days → 58.33% accuracy

3. **🎮 RL Parameter Tuning** (4 experiments)
   - Best: lr=0.001, ε=0.5 → Sharpe ratio 1.33

4. **📊 Data Split Analysis** (4 experiments)
   - Optimal: 70/15/15 split

5. **🏆 Performance Benchmarking** (6 strategies)
   - Combined RL-LSTM: **29.84% annual return**

6. **🔬 Statistical Significance** (15 comparisons)
   - Validated superior performance
